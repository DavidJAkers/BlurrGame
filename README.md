# BlurrGame
Game using Discogs API. 

Try to guess the album name and artist from a blurred image of the album cover within a limited number of guesses Each guess reduces the blur amount, but reduces the amount of points received from a correct guess.

The game ends when either both name and artist are guessed (win) or after 5 guesses (loss).

# Built using React, with extensive use of React hooks
Game state managed using React useState and useEffect, allowing user to change genre and decade of the album and updating 
the API fetch accordingly.
Game data is stored locally, allowing users to view their game history and data of % of games won and longest win-streak.

This was a final project for a class on React, and as such organization of React State isn't fully optimal.

Unfortunately, unlike the Discogs website's search function, this API's search function does not have popularity-based search functionality. As such, most of the albums generated by the API are very niche. With more time, I could instead pick out a large variety of albums myself, and use the API to retrieve the data based on the album id for the albums I've chosen. This way, the albums would be more recognizable and the game would be more fun and interactive.

TODO's:

Refactor React State

Improve styling with more aesthetic ui elements

If to be deployed online, add backend components, such as database to store user login information and game history
